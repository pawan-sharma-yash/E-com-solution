# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive design system using Swift Package Manager that provides consistent spacing and typography standards for the E-Commerce iOS application. The design system will serve as a centralized source of truth for visual design tokens, ensuring consistency across all UI components and screens while making it easy for developers to apply standardized spacing and font sizes throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized design system package, so that I can maintain consistent spacing and typography across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the design system package is created THEN it SHALL be implemented as a Swift Package Manager module
2. WHEN the package is integrated THEN it SHALL be accessible from all parts of the main application
3. WHEN the package is updated THEN it SHALL automatically propagate changes to all consuming modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized spacing values, so that I can create consistent layouts without hardcoding spacing values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing layouts THEN the system SHALL provide predefined spacing constants for common use cases
2. WHEN spacing is applied THEN it SHALL follow a consistent scale (e.g., 4pt, 8pt, 12pt, 16pt, 24pt, 32pt, 48pt)
3. WHEN developers need spacing THEN they SHALL access semantic spacing names (e.g., .small, .medium, .large) rather than raw values
4. WHEN responsive design is needed THEN the system SHALL provide different spacing values for different screen sizes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized font sizes and typography styles, so that I can maintain consistent text appearance across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide predefined font size constants
2. WHEN typography is applied THEN it SHALL include semantic naming (e.g., .headline, .body, .caption)
3. WHEN font styles are used THEN they SHALL include both size and weight specifications
4. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN the system SHALL support Dynamic Type scaling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy integration with SwiftUI, so that I can apply design tokens seamlessly in my views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using SwiftUI THEN the design system SHALL provide View extensions for easy application
2. WHEN applying spacing THEN developers SHALL use modifier syntax (e.g., .padding(.designSystem.medium))
3. WHEN applying typography THEN developers SHALL use font modifiers (e.g., .font(.designSystem.headline))
4. WHEN building components THEN the design system SHALL integrate naturally with SwiftUI's declarative syntax

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the design system to be maintainable and extensible, so that I can easily add new design tokens as the application grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new design tokens are needed THEN they SHALL be easily added to the system
2. WHEN the design system evolves THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
3. WHEN documentation is needed THEN the package SHALL include clear usage examples
4. WHEN testing is required THEN the design system SHALL include unit tests for its components
